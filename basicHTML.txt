Block Level Elements

   <div> is a universal content divider...it is used to group similar html elements

   <h1>-<h6> are heading tags

   <p> is a text paragraph

   <pre></pre> is for pre-formatted text (i think it keeps the newline characters)

   <hr> is a horizontal line

   Block Level Elements use the full width available
        -if they're in <body> then they are the full webpage.
        -if they're in another BLE, they are that element's width
   Height is calculated based on contents

Inline Elements

    <a> tag --designed to create links.
        often used with href --> <a href="http:www.google.com">Click here for google!</a>

    <span>  it wraps a part of a text (so you can edit that section in other ways)

    <button> - creates a button...text in between the tags is the button text

    <b></b> makes text bold in between tags

    <sub></sub> or <sup></sup>  makes text subscript
